        <p>I am currently employed part-time at a job where I design Hot Runner Systems for plastic injection molds. On the days I'm not working I am most likely in school. Specifically <a href="http://www.macomb.edu/">Macomb Community College</a> in pursuit of a degree in business management.</p>

        <p> While not at school or at work I workout in my basement. That's not as strange as it sounds, I have all the equipment I would need at a gym down there. I also have been teaching myself to program and make websites (such as this one) with the help of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> and various other rescources.</p>
